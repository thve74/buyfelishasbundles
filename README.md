# BuyFelishasBundles — Mini Shop (single-file)

This repository hosts a single-file HTML shop that works online **and** offline (no build tools).

## Files
- `index.html` — the entire app (products, cart, checkout modal, membership planner).
- Images used by `index.html`:
  - `buyfelishasbundles-logo.png`
  - `purex-bundle.jpg`
  - `tide-pods-scott.jpg`
  - `tide-yellow.jpg`
  - `gain-green.jpg`
  - `fabuloso-six.jpg` (alias of `fabuloso-bundle.jpg`)
  - `bundle8-restock.jpg`
  - `bfb-poster.jpg`

> Optional: If you add a `bfb-promo.mp4` video, the "Brand Video" section will play it inline. Otherwise, the page still works with a helpful fallback.

## GitHub Pages
1. Upload all files to the repo root (not inside a subfolder).
2. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set Source to **Deploy from a branch**, choose `main` and `/root`.
3. After publish, your site will be live at the Pages URL.

## Payments
- Cash App button copies your **Final Total** and pre-fills the **Order ID + address** note.
- Crypto (NOWPayments) button is wired as a placeholder hook — replace with your live NOWPayments widget link when ready.
